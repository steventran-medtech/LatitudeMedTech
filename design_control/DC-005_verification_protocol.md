# DC-005 — Verification Protocol
**Document:** DC-005 · Version 1.0 · 2026-06-05  
**Approved by:** Steven Tran

---

## Purpose

This document defines the procedures for executing and interpreting all
design input verification tests. Tests are implemented in `dc_verify.py`
(same directory). This document explains *why* each test exists, *what* it
checks, and *what to do* when it fails.

---

## Test Execution Modes

| Mode | Command | Scope | When to Run |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static | `python design_control\dc_verify.py` | No server required | Before every commit |
| Live | `python design_control\dc_verify.py --live` | Requires server on :8000 | Before every PR merge |
| Full | `python design_control\dc_verify.py --full` | Live + agent dry-run | Before any Alpha release |
| Targeted | `python design_control\dc_verify.py --di DI-015` | Single DI prefix | After targeted change |

Exit code: `0` = all active tests pass. `1` = one or more FAIL. `2` = configuration error.

---

## Pre-Commit Gate (Mandatory)

The following static tests must pass before `git commit` on any code change:

```
DI-001-C  Disclaimer constant present in orchestrator.py
DI-001-D  Label constant present in orchestrator.py
DI-015-A  No secrets in source tree
DI-015-B  No shell=True in subprocess calls
DI-015-D  Security headers present in server.py
DI-016-A  DISCLAIMER string in orchestrator.py
DI-016-B  LABEL string in orchestrator.py
DI-016-C  Label value is a permitted readiness label
```

If any of these fail, the commit must be blocked until fixed.

## Test Descriptions and Failure Guidance

### DI-001 — Coaching Brief

**test_DI_001_C** — Readiness label in orchestrator  
Check: `LABEL` constant in `orchestrator.py` is non-empty.  
Fail action: Add `LABEL = "Alpha — Steve Review Required"` to orchestrator.py.

**test_DI_001_D** — Disclaimer in orchestrator  
Check: `DISCLAIMER` constant in `orchestrator.py` contains the canonical text.  
Fail action: Restore the canonical disclaimer from `compliance.md`.

---

### DI-002 — Human Review Gate

**test_DI_002_A** — Review queue route exists  
Check: `POST /api/review` or equivalent pending-list route in `server.py`.  
Fail action: Review was removed or renamed — restore or update route.

**test_DI_002_B** — Approve route  
Check: `POST /api/review/{item_id}/approve` or `{id}/approve` in `server.py`.  
Fail action: Approve endpoint missing; gate is broken — restore immediately (P0).

**test_DI_002_C** — Reject route  
Check: `POST /api/review/{item_id}/reject` in `server.py`.  
Fail action: Same as approve — restore immediately (P0).

**test_DI_002_D** — Edit route  
Check: `POST /api/review/{item_id}/edit` in `server.py`.  
Fail action: Edit feature removed; P1 — restore in current sprint.

---

### DI-003 — Knowledge Base

**test_DI_003_A** — KBQuery importable  
Check: `kb_query.py` exists and `KBQuery` class is defined.  
Fail action: File missing or class removed — check git history for last good state.

**test_DI_003_B** — KB subdirectories exist  
Check: `knowledge_base/FDA`, `knowledge_base/EU_MDR`, `knowledge_base/IMDRF` exist.  
Fail action: Directory missing — create it and run `run_rag.bat` to populate.

---

### DI-004 — Voice Interface

**test_DI_004_A** — Wake threshold ≤ 0.35  
Check: `WAKE_THRESHOLD` or equivalent constant in `voice_bridge.py` ≤ 0.35.  
Fail action: Value was increased — revert to ≤ 0.35 per CAPA-Voice-001 resolution.

**test_DI_004_B** — Whisper load present  
Check: `whisper.load_model` or `whisper_model` initialisation in `voice_bridge.py`.  
Fail action: Whisper removed; voice cannot transcribe — restore.

**test_DI_004_D** — Intent dispatch present  
Check: `tool_use` or `tools=` in voice_bridge.py dispatch logic.  
Fail action: Routing logic removed; all voice queries go to default — restore.

**test_DI_004_E** — SILENCE_DURATION = 1.5  
Check: `SILENCE_DURATION` constant equals 1.5 (float or int).  
Fail action: Value changed outside approved range. Values < 0.8 cause cut-off;
values > 2.0 cause unacceptable latency. Restore to 1.5 unless CAPA-approved.

---

### DI-005 — Task Notifications

**test_DI_005_A** — Notify endpoint  
Check: `POST /api/voice/notify` in `server.py`.  
Fail action: Endpoint removed — spoken task completions will stop working.

**test_DI_005_B** — Notification queue guarded  
Check: `_notification_queue` in `voice_bridge.py`.  
Fail action: Queue removed — notifications may fire when voice is not active.

---

### DI-006 — Persistent Voice Session

**test_DI_006_A** — useVoiceSession is app-level  
Check: `useVoiceSession` imported in `App.jsx`, NOT in any individual view file.  
Fail action: Hook was moved to a tab view — session will reset on navigation.

**test_DI_006_B** — VoiceStatusBadge in App.jsx header  
Check: `VoiceStatusBadge` present in `App.jsx`.  
Fail action: Badge removed from header — users lose live voice state visibility.

---

### DI-007 — Content Generation

**test_DI_007_B** — title_from_body exists  
Check: `title_from_body` function defined in `content_agent.py`.  
Fail action: Function removed — titles will be raw model output (may contain non-Latin).

**test_DI_007_C** — Banned phrases in system prompt  
Check: At least one banned phrase (e.g., "leverage", "robust", "synergy") appears
in the system prompt string in `content_agent.py`.  
Fail action: System prompt replaced or truncated — content quality controls removed.

**test_DI_007_D** — clean_title exists  
Check: `clean_title` function defined in `content_agent.py`.  
Fail action: Function removed — non-Latin characters will appear in filenames and slugs.

---

### DI-009 — Slide Decks

**test_DI_009_B** — Brand palette constants  
Check: `LM_BLACK`, `LM_SLATE`, `LM_BLUE` constants in `deck_agent.py` with correct hex values.  
Fail action: Constants renamed or removed — decks will not render Latitude branding.

**test_DI_009_C** — Deck routes  
Check: `/api/documents/decks` in `server.py`.  
Fail action: Deck gallery will be empty; download broken.

---

### DI-010 — ISO Coach

**test_DI_010_A** — ISO coach agent exists  
Check: `iso_coach_agent.py` exists and is importable.  
Fail action: File removed — ISO coaching feature down.

**test_DI_010_B** — No --all from UI  
Check: The `--all` flag handling code is absent from the ISO coach's API route
handler (i.e., `--all` is only accessible via CLI, not via the API endpoint).  
Fail action: Flag exposed in API — UI could generate all clauses at once.

---

### DI-011 — M&A Intelligence

**test_DI_011_A** — QARA in M&A agent  
Check: "QARA" appears in `ma_intelligence_agent.py` or `.claude/agents/ma-intelligence-agent.md`.  
Fail action: QARA framework removed — deal analysis will miss integration risk dimension.

---

### DI-012 — Regulatory Briefings

**test_DI_012_B** — submit_for_review in briefing_agent  
Check: `submit_for_review` called in `briefing_agent.py`.  
Fail action: Briefings bypass review queue — human gate broken for briefings.

---

Check: `skills_profile.py` exists and `SKILLS.md` route in `server.py`.

---

### DI-015 — Security

**test_DI_015_A** — No secrets in source  
Check: Grep all `.py`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.json`, `.md` files (excluding `venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `.gitignore`-excluded paths) for patterns:
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-`, `TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-`, `BRAVE_API_KEY=BSA`, `HF_TOKEN=hf_`.  
Fail action: **STOP ALL WORK.** Remove the secret immediately, rotate the key, and
force-push with git history rewrite if already committed.

**test_DI_015_B** — No shell=True  
Check: Grep all `.py` files for `shell=True` or `shell = True`.

**test_DI_015_C** — Rate limiting in server.py  
Check: `SlowAPI` import or `rate_limit` or `RateLimiter` in `server.py`.  
Fail action: Rate limiter removed — API is open to abuse. Restore before next deploy.

Fail action: File endpoints vulnerable to directory traversal.

---

## Interpreting Results

| Test Result | Action |
|---|---|
| PASS | No action required. |
| FAIL (P0) | Block commit/PR. Fix immediately before any other work. |
| FAIL (P1) | Fix within current sprint. Document in CAPA if 3+ P1 failures. |
| WARN | Investigate; resolve within one sprint or document as accepted risk. |
| SKIP | Test was skipped due to missing dependency. Investigate and re-enable. |

## CAPA Trigger

If `dc_verify.py` produces 3 or more FAIL results in a single run, open a CAPA:
```
Athena/ops/hr/CAPA-DC-NNN.md
```
Use the CAPA template in `ops/hr/`. Steven must approve before work resumes on
the failing area. Reference this document as the governing requirement source.
